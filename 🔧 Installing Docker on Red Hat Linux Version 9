ðŸ”§ **Installing Docker on Red Hat Linux Version 9**

Here's a step-by-step guide to installing Docker on Red Hat Linux Version 9:

1. Launch an AWS EC2 instance with RHEL-9.2.0_HVM-20230503-x86_64-41.
2. Connect to the EC2 instance via SSH and switch to the root user by running the following command:
   ```
   sudo -i

   ```

3. Navigate to the `/etc/yum.repos.d/` directory using the following command:
   ```
   cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
   ```

4. Update the system packages using the `dnf` package manager by executing the following command:
   ```
   sudo dnf update -y
   ```

5. Create a new repository file called `docker.repo` using a text editor such as `vi`:
   ```
   vi docker.repo
   ```

   Inside the `docker.repo` file, insert the following content:
   ```
   [docker-ce-stable]
   name=Docker CE Stable - $basearch
   baseurl=https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/$releasever/$basearch/stable
   enabled=1
   gpgcheck=1
   gpgkey=https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/gpg
   ```

   Save the file and exit the text editor.

6. Install Docker using the `yum` package manager by running the following command:
   ```
   yum install docker-ce --nobest
   ```

7. Start the Docker service using the following command:
   ```
   systemctl start docker
   ```

8. Check the status of the Docker service to ensure it is running without any issues:
   ```
   systemctl status docker
   ```

   You should see output indicating that the Docker service is active and running.

9. Test the Docker installation by running a simple Docker container:
   ```
   sudo docker run hello-world
   ```

   Docker will download the necessary image and run a container that prints a "Hello from Docker!" message.

10.Enable the Docker service to start automatically on system boot by executing the following command:


   systemctl enable docker
   
   This creates a symlink to the Docker service unit file in the appropriate systemd directory.

11.Verify if the Docker service is enabled by running the following command:


   systemctl is-enabled docker
   
   The output should indicate that the Docker service is "enabled," confirming that it will start automatically on system boot.
