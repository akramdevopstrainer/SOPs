# Launch Nginx on AWS EC2 Instance

This SOP provides step-by-step instructions to launch Nginx on an AWS EC2 instance using Amazon Linux 2 AMI with the specified AMI name "amzn2-ami-kernel-5.10-hvm-2.0.20230404.1-x86_64-gp2".

## Step 1: Launch EC2 Instance

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Go to the EC2 service.
3. Click on the "Launch Instances" button.
4. Select the "Amazon Linux 2 LTS" AMI from the list of available AMIs.
5. Choose an instance type that meets your requirements and click "Next: Configure Instance Details".
6. In the "Configure Instance Details" section, configure the instance settings such as the number of instances, VPC, subnet, etc., as per your requirements.
7. Click "Next: Add Storage" to configure the storage settings for the instance.
8. Optionally, you can add additional storage volumes if required.
9. Click "Next: Add Tags" to add any tags to the instance for better organization and management.
10. Click "Next: Configure Security Group" to configure the security group settings for the instance.
11. Configure the security group rules to allow incoming traffic on port 22 (SSH) and port 80 (HTTP) to allow SSH access and Nginx traffic.
12. Click "Review and Launch" to review your instance settings.
13. Review your settings and click "Launch" to launch the EC2 instance.
14. Choose an existing key pair or create a new key pair to securely connect to the instance via SSH.
15. Click "Launch Instances" to launch the EC2 instance.

## Step 2: Connect to EC2 Instance

1. Once the instance is launched, note down the public IP or DNS name of the instance from the EC2 dashboard.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.
3. Navigate to the directory where your key pair (.pem) file is stored.
4. Run the following command to connect to the EC2 instance using SSH, replacing `<YOUR-KEY-PAIR-FILE>` with the path to your key pair file and `<INSTANCE-PUBLIC-IP>` with the public IP or DNS name of your EC2 instance:

   ssh -i <YOUR-KEY-PAIR-FILE>.pem ec2-user@<INSTANCE-PUBLIC-IP>

Enter "yes" to confirm the SSH fingerprint and establish a connection to the EC2 instance.

Step 3: Install Nginx
Update the package manager on the EC2 instance by running the following command:


sudo yum update -y
Install Nginx by running the following command:


sudo yum install nginx -y
Start the Nginx service by running the following command:


sudo systemctl start nginx
Enable Nginx to start automatically on boot by running the following command:

sudo systemctl enable nginx

Step 4: Access Nginx Web Server

Open a web browser on your local machine.

Enter the public IP or DNS name of the EC2 instance in the address bar.

You should now be able to access the Nginx web server running on the EC2 instance.

Note: Please replace `<YOUR-KEY-PAIR-FILE>` with the actual path
